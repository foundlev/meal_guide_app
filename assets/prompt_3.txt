Below are the data about my meals (including foods, drinks, supplements, vitamins) and my workouts over a certain period of time, sorted by day. The data includes the types of meals, their calorie content, as well as the amount of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. For workouts, the burned calories are indicated. Calories and composition of foods were estimated by AI in some cases and may contain inaccuracies. There is also a history of the short estimates (number, short text) of my diet that you sent earlier. Based on this information, the AI should:

1. Analyze my current eating habits and routine.
2. Evaluate the positive and negative aspects.
3. Identify any missing nutrients (microelements, vitamins) and recommend foods that could supply them.
4. Suggest ways to improve my diet.
5. Provide a rating of my diet from 0 to 100, where 0 is very poor and 100 is ideal. When evaluating, take into account the history of previous evaluations, if it is available.
6. Give a 2-3 word assessment of my dietary habits. When evaluating, take into account the history of previous evaluations, if it is available.
7. Format the result in the following JSON format:

{
  "short": "<str:short>",
  "general_comment": "<str:general_comment>",
  "positives": "<str:positives>",
  "negatives": "<str:negatives>",
  "to_change": <str:to_change>,
  "sport": <str:sport>,
  "rate": {
    "number": <int:rate>,
    "text": "<str:rate>"
  }
}

Where:
- <str:general_comment>: A highly detailed free-text description of my current diet, including its overall quality, recent changes.
- <str:positives>: A highly detailed free-text of the positive aspects of my diet.
- <str:negatives>: A highly detailed free-text of the negative aspects or shortcomings of my diet, including missing nutrients or vitamins.
- <str:sport>: A highly detailed free-text description of my current sport trainings–± the change of them and their frequency recently and its relationship to my diet.
- <str:to_change>:  A highly detailed free-text general recommendations what to change in my diet. Mention any lack of certain microelements/vitamins and suggest foods that can supply them.
- <str:short>: A very short recommendation (just 7-12 words) on what to improve in my diet.
- <int:rate>: An integer from 0 to 100 rating my diet.
- <str:rate>: A 3-4 word assessment of my diet. Try to use clearer language.

The answer must be in Russian language only.
Use the <bold></bold> tag to bold text and the <italic></italic> tag to italicize text. Separate the text into paragraphs using the <p> tag for better readability only in <str:general_comment>, <str:positives>, <str:negatives>, <str:to_change>.
